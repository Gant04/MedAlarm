/**
 * This class handles all the state changes for alarm instances. You need to
 * register all alarm instances with the state manager if you want them to
 * be activated. If a major time change has occurred (ie. TIMEZONE_CHANGE, TIMESET_CHANGE),
 * then you must also re-register instances to fix their states.
 *
 * Please see {@link #registerInstance) for special transitions when major time changes
 * occur.
 *
 * Following states:
 *
 * SILENT_STATE:
 * This state is used when the alarm is activated, but doesn't need to display anything. It
 * is in charge of changing the alarm instance state to a LOW_NOTIFICATION_STATE.
 *
 * LOW_NOTIFICATION_STATE:
 * This state is used to notify the user that the alarm will go off
 * { @link Alarm.LOW_NOTIFICATION_HOUR_OFFSET}. This
 * state handles the state changes to HIGH_NOTIFICATION_STATE, HIDE_NOTIFICATION_STATE and
 * DISMISS_STATE.
 *
 * HIDE_NOTIFICATION_STATE:
 * This is a transient state of the LOW_NOTIFICATION_STATE, where the user wants to hide the
 * notification. This will sit and wait until the HIGH_PRIORITY_NOTIFICATION should go off.
 *
 * HIGH_NOTIFICATION_STATE:
 * This state behaves like the LOW_NOTIFICATION_STATE, but doesn't allow the user to hide it.
 * This state is in charge of triggering a FIRED_STATE or DISMISS_STATE.
 *
 * SNOOZED_STATE:
 * The SNOOZED_STATE behaves like a HIGH_NOTIFICATION_STATE, but with a different message. It
 * also increments the alarm time in the instance to reflect the new snooze time.
 *
 * FIRED_STATE:
 * The FIRED_STATE is used when the alarm is firing. It will start the AlarmService, and wait
 * until the user interacts with the alarm via SNOOZED_STATE or DISMISS_STATE change. If the user
 * doesn't then it might be change to MISSED_STATE if auto-silenced was enabled.
 *
 * MISSED_STATE:
 * The MISSED_STATE is used when the alarm already fired, but the user could not interact with
 * it. At this point the alarm instance is dead and we check the parent alarm to see if we need
 * to disable or schedule a new alarm_instance. There is also a notification shown to the user
 * that he/she missed the alarm and that stays for
 * { @link Alarm.MISSED_TIME_TO_LIVE_HOUR_OFFSET} or until the user acknownledges it.
 *
 * DISMISS_STATE:
 * This is really a transient state that will properly delete the alarm instance. Use this state,
 * whenever you want to get rid of the alarm instance. This state will also check the alarm
 * parent to see if it should disable or schedule a new alarm instance.
